          <p>The immune system is a body's system of defenses against agents that cause disease. Pathogens and foreign molecules are examples of disease-causing agents. A pathogen is a bacterium, fungus, virus, or other disease causeing agent. A foreign molecule is referred to as an antigen.</p>
          <p>The immune system protects the body from disease causing microorganisms. Our bodies are constantly being overwhelmed by microorganisms. Some of these microorganisms are viruses (which can cause cold and influenza...), some are bacteria (which can cause pneumonia and food poisoning...), and others are parasites and fungi. We are usually unaware that our bodies are fighting against microorganisms. Not until our immune system is damaged.</p>
          <p>When the immune system does not function properly, it severely damages the body. For example, Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrom, better known as AIDS, is caused by a virus. AIDS prevents the body from fighting off microorganisms that attack our bodies, which leads to an infection. Another example is the Human Immunodeficiency Virus, or HIV. HIV attacks an important immune system cell, the T-cell lymphocyte. Lymphocytes are a category of white blood cells.</p>
          <p>There are two main steps that must occur in order for the immune system to function properly. 1)It is necessary that they body recognize the invasion of foreign microorganisms. 2)The immune system response must be quickly activated before too many body tissue cells are damaged by the invaders. There are two types of immune system defenses: the non-specific defense and the specific defense.</p>
          <p>Non-specific defenses include the skin and mucous membranes. These prevent microorganisms from entering the body. The surface of our skin is slightly acidic. This makes it difficult for many microorganisms to survive. Enzyme lysozyme is present in sweat, tears, and saliva. It helps kill many bacteria. Mucous membranes line many of the body's entrances (those that are open in the respiratory, digestive, and uro-genital tracts). Bacteria is trapped in these membranes in thick mucous layers which prevent the bacteria from entering the body. In the upper respiratory tract, hairs line the nose and trap bacteria. Bacteria is inhaled depper into the respiratory tract and is then pushed back out by the cilia (tiny hairs that line the trachea and bronchii).
          Why are smokers more susceptible to respiratory infection? Hot cigarette smoke disables the cilia which slows the movement of mucous and bacteria out of the respiratory tract. After one quits smoking, the cilia are regenerated and new quitters then cough and bring up large amounts of mucous, which eventually subsides.</p>
          <p>Inflammatory response is an immunse response confined to a small area. FOr example, when a finger is cut, the area becomes slightly inflamed, red, and warm. These are signs of an inflammatory response.</p>
          <p>Non-specific lymphocytes carry out "search and destroy" missions. If there is an encounter with a foreign microorganism, they will engulf the invader or destroy the invader with enzymes. Macrophages and Neutrophils are some non-specific lymphocytes. Macrophages are large lymphocytes which engulf foreign cells. They are also called phagocytes. Phagein, which means "to kill" and kytos, "cell". So phagocytes kill cells, foreign cells to be specific. Neutrophils are cells that migrate to areas that have been invaded by bacteria (an example would be entrances formed by cuts in the skin). These cells phagocytize microorganisms and release microorganism-killing enzymes. Neutrophils die quickly. Pus is an accumulation of dead neutrophils.
          There are natural killer cells which kill infected virus cells by punching a hole in the cell membrane, causing the cell to lyse, or break apart.</p>
          
         <p>Next are the specific defenses.</p>
